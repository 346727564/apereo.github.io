The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the *third* release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read more about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/08/04/520rc2-release/).

## Test Drive

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.2.0-RC3</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.2.0-RC3
```

## Minors

- MongoDb authentication is improved to honor the MongoDb connection pool and threads which monitor that pool.
- The default port for the management web application when run in embedded mode is now switched to `8444` to avoid conflicts with the main CAS web application server when both are run in the same environment.
- The default ability of defining Spring beans in XML inside the management web application has been removed.
- The default ability of defining Spring beans in XML/Groovy inside the CAS web application has been removed.
- The management web application is now able to advertise readiness in logs via ascii art.
- Thanks to [@scalding](https://github.com/scalding), generating persistent ids in a Shibboleth-friendly way now correctly takes into account the salt and more.
- Thanks to [@robertoschwald](https://github.com/robertoschwald), generating primary keys for hibernate schemas is improved to take on a more `native` approach with some caveats documented that affect MySQL while running in a Galera cluster.
- Thanks to [@tduehr](https://github.com/tduehr), generating random secure strings falls back to a more performant though ever-so-slightly less secure strategy and algorithm until Java 9 is released.
- The multifactor trusted device functionality for Google Authenticator and Swivel now correctly registers the relevant MFA flow into the CAS webflow engine at runtime.
- Thanks to [@pdrados](https://github.com/pdrados), the attribute name carrying the principal DN as part of LDAP authentication is now set to a static fixed name to avoid attribute encoding issues and easier release policies.
- A number of small readjustments to schemas that deal with storing trusted device records in databases, in cases where a number of field names clashes with reserved database keywords. 
- Thanks to [@SRieckhoff](https://github.com/SRieckhoff), a possible NPE with SPNEGO authentication is now prevented.
- SAML1 validation response is now updated in the documentation to ensure it matches the structure produced by CAS.
- Thanks to [@tduehr](https://github.com/tduehr), Apache Ignite support is given the ability to run in client mode.
- Thanks to [@kingjared](https://github.com/kingjared), generating SAML1 assertions gains an `issueLength` property to set the interval between the `NotBefore` and `NotOnOrAfter` timestamps.

## Caffein for Guava Caching

Most if not all internal caching strategies and policies have switched from using the Guava library to Caffein. This is for the most part an invisible change, yet the swich allows CAS to dictate more granular expiration policies for caches that apply to each individual entry in the cache, rather than the cache itself as a whole.
 
## Authentication Interrupt

CAS has the ability to pause and interrupt the authentication flow to reach out to external services and resources, querying for status and setings that would then dictate how CAS should manage and control the SSO session. Interrupt services are able to present notification messages to the user, provide options for redirects to external services, etc. A common use case of this functionality deals with presenting a bulletin board during the authentication flow to present messages and announcements to select users and then optionally require that audience to complete a certain task before CAS is able to honor the authentication request and establish a session.

[See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Webflow-Customization-Interrupt.html) for more info.

## JMeter Performance Testing

Thanks to [@astohn](https://github.com/astohn), JMeter scripts for performance and stress testing CAS are [now available](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/planning/High-Availability-Performance-Testing.html#jmeter).

## OpenID Connect Pairwise Subject Identifiers

OpenID Connect support in CAS now presents the ability to support different subject types. This specifically includes support for `pairwise` subject id generation. [See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OIDC-Authentication.html) for more info.

## Attribute Consent Policy Per Service

Handling attribute consent now takes on a more wholesome API approach where there exists a `consentPolicy` that can dictate how attribute are selected and qualified for consent. See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Consent.html) for more info.

## Time-based Multifactor Authentication Trigger

Adaptive authentication can also be configured to trigger multifactor authentication based on specific days and times.

See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Adaptive-Authentication.html) for more info.

## SAML2 Artifact Resolution

SAML2 capabilities of CAS in this release add support for the Artifact Resolution profile.
See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html) for more info.

## SAML2 Attribute Queries

SAML2 capabilities of CAS in this release add support for the Attribute Query profile.
See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html) for more info.

## SAML2 POST SimpleSign

SAML2 capabilities of CAS in this release add support for the POST SimpleSign profile.
See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html) for more info.

## Protocol Attributes Release per Service

Attribute release policies gain a small setting to control whether the application is authorized and allowed to receive authentication/protocol attributes. [See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Policies.html) for more info.

## OAuth & OpenID Connect Authorized Grant/Response Types

[OAuth](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html#register-clients) and [OpenID Connect](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OIDC-Authentication.html#register-clients) service definitions now get to specify the list of supported and authorized response and grant types. Note that for the time being, the absence of authorized response and grant types in the configration simply means the service is allowed to accept everything though this may change in the future.

Additionally, some foundational work is done to allow for parsing of requested scopes so they can later be mapped to attribute and claim release policies.

## Unique Principal Authentication Policy

An [additional authentication policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Properties.html#authentication-policy) is now provided that can prevent an authentication event, if the user has already logged on and has a session with CAS.

## Surrogate Authentication Improvements

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>This may be a breaking change.
  Consult <a href="https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/">the docs</a> to learn more.
</div>

Surrogate authentication (Impersonation) gains the ability to dictate an expiration policy assigned to a surrogate session. Additionally, surrogate account storage and querying can now be done via a REST resource as well. Access strategies for impersonation are also improved to allow per-service authorization rules.

Note that the baseline module to include in the overlay has changed in this release candidate to clearly separate core and webflow functionality. [Consult this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Surrogate-Authentication.html) for more info.

## SAML2 Improvements

SAML2 capabilities of CAS in this release provide support for the following:

- An analysis and evaluation of the SAML2 support based on the Federation Interop profile is now [available](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html#federation-interop-evaluation).
- Metadata caching can be controlled via the `validUntil` element in the entity metadata.
- A [new attribute release filter](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html#entity-attributes-filter) is now available based on metadata entity attributes.
- All signing operations are now able to consult metadata in order to resolve signing keys and iterate through all to find a successful matching candidate.
