The official CAS `5.2.0` GA was released on [November 27th, 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.2.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.3.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **fourth** release candidate in the `5.3.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.3.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2018/03/30/530rc3-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.0-RC4</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-gradle-overlay-template), adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.3.0-RC4
```

## Minors

- Thanks to [@leleuj](https://github.com/leleuj), validation of OAuth and OpenID Connect requests gain improvements in terms of protocol compatibility.
- The rendering syntax of CAS attributes in the validation response can now be controlled using CAS settings to enable inline rendering. (i.e. `<cas:attribute name="givenName" value="John"></cas:attribute>`)
- Thanks to [@frett](https://github.com/frett), the initialization of the login webflow is fixed to only execute once.
- Refreshing CAS configuration should allow for re-initialization of the service registry, if CAS is configured to populate the service registry database from JSON service files.
- Thanks to [@NgSekLong](https://github.com/NgSekLong), the validation of the OAuth `client_secret` parameter is made optional if it's left undefined for the OAuth service.
- CAS test coverage has improved slightly with a number of additional tests where now coverage is at almost 50%.
- Auditing a *password change* operation using the [CAS password management](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Password-Management.html) features is fixed to correctly catalog failures.

## Delegated Authentication & MFA

[Delegating authentication events to ADFS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/ADFS-Integration.html) as well as [all other external identity providers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Delegate-Authentication.html) are now revisited to handle multifactor authentication flows better, once the flow travels back from the identity provider to CAS after authentication.
