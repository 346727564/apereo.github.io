The official CAS `5.2.0` GA was released on [November 27th, 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.2.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.3.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **third** release candidate in the `5.3.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.3.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2018/02/09/530rc2-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.0-RC3</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-gradle-overlay-template), adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.3.0-RC3
```

## Minors

- CAS integration tests for Couchbase, DynamoDb and InfluxDb are now automated/enabled via relevant Docker images running as part of Travis CI.
- Thanks to [@frett](https://github.com/frett), TGC domain names are once more sanitized; an oversight that snuck into CAS after  adopting Project Lombok.
- Thanks to [@luis100](https://github.com/luis100), delegating authentication to SAML IdPs now is able to handle `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST` bindings.
- Thanks to [@tsschmidt](https://github.com/tsschmidt), loading CAS configuration properties is now made conditional.
- Thanks to [@sbearcsiro](https://github.com/sbearcsiro), overflows when calculating ticket expirations in MongoDb are now prevented.
- Thanks to [@frett](https://github.com/frett), multifactor authentication triggers based on principal/authentication attributes are now allowed to proceed in the absence of a `service` parameter.
- Thanks to [@dodok1](https://github.com/dodok1), multiple RADIUS servers can now be specified in CAS properties, separated by comma.
- Thanks to [@fmartelli](https://github.com/fmartelli), delegated SAML2 authentication gains a new settings to allow for the specification of the `AttributeConsumingServiceIndex` exposed by Pac4j.
- CAS proxy-granting ticket definitions are now correctly registered in the ticket catalog.
- Thanks to [@sbearcsiro](https://github.com/sbearcsiro), a number of time units in CAS are now corrected to properly recognize seconds instead of milli-seconds.
- CAS configuration metadata is corrected to properly generate the needed JSON metadata based on configuration settings.
- Thanks to [@sbearcsiro](https://github.com/sbearcsiro), the embedded Apache Tomcat instance is tweaked using a *Customizer* component provided by Spring Boot so that CAS implementations can override the factory themselves (eg to enable JNDI) whilst also benefitting from the CAS tomcat configuration properties.

## SAML Service Provider Metadata via REST

SAML2 service provider metadata can now be fetched from more traditional REST endpoints, as an alternative to deploying an MDQ server.
[See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-DynamicMetadata.html) for more info.

## OAuth2 Audits

Thanks to [@dima767](https://github.com/dima767), OAuth2 and OpenID Connect interactions (authentication requests and user profile responses) with CAS are now sent to the audit log.

## SAML2 Service Providers

The following new [SAML2 service providers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-SAML-SP-Integrations.html) are now supported by CAS out of the box:

- Concur Solutions
- PollEverywhere

## Registered Service Access Strategy Audits

Thanks to [@dima767](https://github.com/dima767), [service access strategy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Service-Access-Strategy.html) events are now sent to the audit log in the event that the principal does not carry enough attributes to be granted access.

## Delegated Authentication  Access Strategy Audits

While delegating authentication to an external identity provider, access strategy events that enforce the usage of the external identity provider are now sent to the audit log.

## Audit API Improvements

In collaboration with [@dima767](https://github.com/dima767), CAS components that are typically not managed as Spring `@Bean`s are now put through a mini *framework* so thet can become eligible for auditing purposes. The API changes in this area, while  non-intrusive, allow CAS to audit the likes of the services access strategy events  noted above.

## Impersonation Groovy Access Strategy

Impersonation features of CAS gain access to a Groovy option to execute [authorization rules for surrogate authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Surrogate-Authentication.html#surrogate-access-strategy).

## X.509 Authentication via Request Headers

Thanks to [@hdeadman](https://github.com/hdeadman), X509 authentication now optionally gains the ability to extract the certificate from a request header.

## CAS Protocol Behavior

Certain aspects of the CAS protocol such as proxy or renewed authentication [can be controlled](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Properties.html#global-sso-behavior) via CAS settings.
