The official CAS `5.3.0` GA was released on [June 29th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.3.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.0.0`. Note that this is a **major release** of the CAS software which *may* present significant changes in architecture, configuration or behavior. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release.

This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **second** release candidate in the `6.0.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2018/08/03/600rc1-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties
casVersion=6.0.0-RC2
```

## Changes

{:toc}

### New & Noteworthy

#### WAR Overlay

The Maven WAR overlay template is now deprecated and moved aside. The reference overlay project simply resides [here](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template) and is transformed to use the Gradle build tool instead. This is done to reduce maintenance overhead and simplify the deployment strategy while allowing future attempts to make auto-generation of the overlay as comfortable as possible.

#### OAuth2 UMA

A first pass at OAuth2 User-Managed Access is [now available](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/OAuth-UMA-Protocol.html). This is very much a rough take
and will require some fine-tuning and tweaking in future iterations to fully make it spec-compliant and functional.

### Small Stuff

- Expired registered service definitions are now blocked by CAS as always, but are not strictly modified in the service registry as disabled services.
- A ton of improvements to the Travis CI integration tests to ensure performance and compliance. This area continues to improve.
- Release of authentication-level attributes, typically those related to protocols or those captured by metadata populators is now controlled via a central policy.
- Generation of CAS configuration metadata is massaged to take into account enumerations and nested inner classes.
- REST API authentication using X509 is now capable of TLS client authentication.
- Delegated authentication gains the ability to use path variables for client names instead of query parameters, for identity providers such as Azure.
- CAS documentation integrates with Angolia for its search capabilities.
- Minor bug fixes to database schema handling, log messages and OATH validations.

### Library Upgrades

- Inspektr
- Pac4j
