The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **fourth** release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read more about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/08/04/520rc2-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.2.0-RC4</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of the overlay, adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.2.0-RC4
```

## Minors

- Thanks to [@CobraFlow](https://github.com/CobraFlow), delegated authentication using CAS is now able to correctly parse the CAS protocol setting.
- Thanks to [@marwatk](https://github.com/marwatk), the password management webflow is now correctly registering an event to respond to *Password Must Change* scenarios.
- Thanks to [@acvcu](https://github.com/acdcu), multifactor authentication bypass options now correctly take into account the principal attribute name.
- Thanks to [@marwatk](https://github.com/marwatk), validating security question answers are now made extensible to account for custom validation rules.
- Thanks to [@bhohler](https://github.com/bhohler), verification of credential's password against Cloud Directory is now done properly.
- Thanks to [@bsandiford](https://github.com/bsandiford), memcached serialization via Kryo now takes into account a few more ticket expiration policies and other components. It is also set to issue a warning if and when unregistered classes in the kryo registry are found.
- Thanks to [@marwatk](https://github.com/marwatk), extensible error handling logic is now built into the password management to ensure password update operations can correctly report back failure events.
- Slight cleanup to ensure MongoDb and Redis ticket registries are able to take advantage of crypto operations.
- Thanks to [@sbearcsiro](https://github.com/sbearcsiro), servide registry auto-initialization from JSON services now is prevented from adding duplicate records.
- Minor improvements to the audit log message where super long messages are now abbreviated down to `125` characters.
- Small improvements in the way access strategy policies are enforced, specially when dealing attribute release policies that have semi complex mapping rules.
- Anchor fragments are now automatically preserved while redirecting back to the application with a ticket.
- MDUI elements for services found in the registry now correctly honor information and privacy URLs.
- Plenty of minor documentation improvements to further explain CAS functionality with better examples and notes.
- CAS as a Spring Boot Application can now be deployed as [a fully-executable file](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Servlet-Container.html).
- Documentation guidelines to explain how to [deploy CAS as an OS service](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Deployment-System-Service.html).

## Management Web Application

### Authentication

Authentication strategies for the CAS management web application have been improved to support a [few more options](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Installing-ServicesMgmt-Webapp.html).

## OAuth User Profile

[Additional options](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html) are now exposed that control the rendering of the OAuth user profile.

## Attribute Consent

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>This may be a breaking change. 
  Consult <a href="https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/">the docs</a> to learn more.
</div>

[Attribute consent](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Consent.html) functionality no longer applies a SHA-512 hashing function to attribute names and values. The consent decisions are now limited to signing and encryption only. With the one-way hash removed, CAS now presents the functionality underneath to decrypt records and present them back to the user in form of administrative dashboards and user interfaces, allowing users to revoke or modify a decision.

## Acceptable Usage Policy

### MongoDb Storage

[Acceptable Usage Policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Webflow-Customization-AUP.html) is now slightly improved to support MongoDb for a storage option.

## Configuration Metadata UI

Accessing [CAS configuration metadata](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Metadata-Repository.html) is now possible via the CAS dashboards:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1205228/30881885-1dc62358-a314-11e7-8ebc-f79c41891d88.png)

Most if not all CAS properties are annotated with `@RequiredProperty` and `@RequiredModule` which are then picked up by the metadata generation process and translated for REST APIs, etc.

## Metrics

### Storage

[CAS metrics](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Metrics.html) may be routed to varying types of databases for storage and analytics.

## REST Service Registry

Managing service definitions may also be carried out via a [REST implementation](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/REST-Service-Management.html) of your choice.

## Library Upgrades

- Spring Boot
- Spring Webflow
- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- Gradle
- Hibernate
- Apache Tomcat
- Apache Http Client
- Spring Data
- Spring MongoDb
- Dropwizard Metrics
- Swagger
- AWS Java SDK

Additionally, Javascript linting process is internally updated to support ECMAScript 6.
