The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **fourth** release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read more about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/08/04/520rc2-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.2.0-RC4</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of the overlay, adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.2.0-RC4
```

## Minors

- Memcached serialization via Kryo now takes into account a few more ticket expiration policies.
- Thanks to [@CobraFlow](https://github.com/CobraFlow), delegated authentication using CAS is now able to correctly parse the CAS protocol setting.
- Thanks to [@marwatk](https://github.com/marwatk), the password management webflow is now correctly registering an event to responded to *Password Must Change* scenarios.
- Thanks to [@marwatk](https://github.com/marwatk), validating security question answers are now made extensible to account for custom validation rules.
- Thanks to [@bhohler](https://github.com/bhohler), verification of credential's password against Cloud Directory is now done properly.

## Management Web Application

### Authentication

Authentication strategies for the CAS management web application have been improved to support a [few more options](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Installing-ServicesMgmt-Webapp.html).

## OAuth User Profile

[Additional options](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html) are now exposed that control the rendering of the OAuth user profile.

## Acceptable Usage Policy

### MongoDb Storage

[Acceptable Usage Policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Webflow-Customization-AUP.html) is now slightly improved to support MongoDb for a storage option.

## Configuration Metadata UI

Accessing [CAS configuration metadata](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Metadata-Repository.html) is now possible via the CAS dashboards:

## Metrics

### Storage

[CAS metrics](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Metrics.html) may be routed to varying types of databases for storage and analytics.

## REST Service Registry

Managing service definitions may also be carried out via a [REST implementation](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/REST-Service-Management.html) of your choice.

## Library Upgrades

- Spring Boot
- Spring Webflow
- jQuery
- jQuery UI
- Gradle
