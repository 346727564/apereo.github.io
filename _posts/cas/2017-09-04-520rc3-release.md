The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the *third* release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read more about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/08/04/520rc2-release/).

## Minors

- MongoDb authentication is improved to honor the MongoDb connection pool and threads which monitor that pool.
- The default port for the management web application when run in embedded mode is now switched to `8444` to avoid conflicts with the main CAS web application server when both are run in the same environment.
- The default ability of defining Spring beans in XML inside the management web application has been removed.
- The default ability of defining Spring beans in XML/Groovy inside the CAS web application has been removed.
- The management web application is now able to advertise readiness in logs via ascii art.
- Thanks to [@scalding](https://github.com/scalding), generating persistent ids in a Shibboleth-friendly way now correctly takes into account the salt and more.
- Thanks to [@robertoschwald](https://github.com/robertoschwald), generating primary keys for hibernate schemas is improved to take on a more `native` approach with some caveats documented that affect MySQL while running in a Galera cluster.
- Thanks to [@tduehr](https://github.com/tduehr), generating random secure strings falls back to a more performant though ever-so-slightly less secure strategy and algorithm until Java 9 is released.
- The multifactor trusted device functionality for Google Authenticator and Swivel now correctly registers the relevant MFA flow into the CAS webflow engine at runtime.
- Thanks to [@SRieckhoff](https://github.com/SRieckhoff), a possible NPE with SPNEGO authentication is now prevented.
- SAML1 validation response is now updated to ensure it matches the latest syntax and structure produced by CAS.

## Authentication Interrupt

CAS has the ability to pause and interrupt the authentication flow to reach out to external services and resources, querying for status and setings that would then dictate how CAS should manage and control the SSO session. Interrupt services are able to present notification messages to the user, provide options for redirects to external services, etc. A common use case of this functionality deals with presenting a bulletin board during the authentication flow to present messages and announcements to select users and then optionally require that audience to complete a certain task before CAS is able to honor the authentication request and establish a session.

[See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Webflow-Customization-Interrupt.html) for more info.

## OpenID Connect Pairwise Subject Identifiers

OpenID Connect support in CAS now presents the ability to support different subject types. This specifically includes support for `pairwise` subject id generation. [See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OIDC-Authentication.html) for more info.

## Attribute Consent Policy Per Service

Handling attribute consent now takes on a more wholesome API approach where there exists a `consentPolicy` that can dictate how attribute are selected and qualified for consent. See [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Consent.html) for more info.
