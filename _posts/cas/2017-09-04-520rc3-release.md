The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the *third* release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

## Minors

- MongoDb authentication is improved to honor the MongoDb connection pool and threads which monitor that pool.
- Generating persistent ids, mostly used to provide an anonymous username to a service, now takes into account the predefined salt.
- The default port for the management web application when run in embedded mode is now switched to `8444` to avoid conflicts with the main CAS web application server when both are run in the same environment.
- The default ability of defining Spring beans in XML inside the management web application has been removed.
- The management web application is now able to advertise readiness in logs via ascii art.
