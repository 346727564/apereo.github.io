The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the first release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

## Community Contributions

- Performance improvements to ensure service selection strategies are properly sorted at runtime.
- Small regression in how URL-based SAML2 metadata resources are retrieved from `http` vs `https` resources.
- Ticket registries properly take into account the task of encoding tickets, if needed, before deleting them.

## Documentation

The [documentation site](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/) for the CAS project is now equipped with a much better search user interface. 

## WebJARs for Static Resources

Targeting CAS deployments in environments that have no network access can be tricky. In this release candidate, CAS begins to beautifully bundle static UI resources (css, javascript, etc) into the build for offline access. These resources are turned into dependencies that the project stuffs into the build by default using WebJARs. The `org.webjars` project seems to package up most things that CAS needs in jars that are available in maven central and the servlet 3.0 specification makes the resources available to be served up by CAS.

Huge thanks to [@hdeadman](https://github.com/hdeadman) for executing on this.

## Trusted Authentication Attributes

The [Trusted Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Trusted-Authentication.html) features of CAS are now able to extract attributes from the remote request object, in cases where CAS is sitting behind a Shibboleth Service Provider, etc.

## Amazon Cloud Directory Authentication

Thanks to [@vulpayga](https://github.com/vulpayga), CAS gains the ability to use [Amazon Cloud Directory for authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/AWS-CloudDirectory-Authentication.html).

## Stormpath Support Removed

[Stormpath](https://stormpath.com/) support has been removed from the codebase. This feature will no longer be available, as Stormpath APIs are soon to be retired in mid August after the Okta acquisition.

## Ticket Validator SSL Configuration

There are areas in CAS where a ticket is issued and validated internally to allow access to other downstream components. The configuration of ticket validation component is now exposed to the entire runtime and takes advantage of familiar CAS settings when it comes to SSL factories and hostname verifications.
 
## Registered Services Endpoint

A [new endpoint](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Monitoring-Statistics.html) is now exposed in CAS that can report back the collection of registered services with CAS.

## YubiKey MongoDb/JPA Storage

[YubiKey multifactor authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/YubiKey-Authentication.html) is now able to use MongoDb or a relational database for persisting device registration records. Improvements are in to also support new device registration workflows.

## Couchbase Authentication

CAS gains the ability to use [Couchbase](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Couchbase-Authentication.html) as an authentication store. Remember that Couchbase can also be used to [manage CAS services](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Couchbase-Service-Management.html) and act as a [ticket store](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Couchbase-Ticket-Registry.html) for HA deployments.

## Apache Cassandra Authentication

Thanks to [@vulpayga](https://github.com/vulpayga), CAS gains the ability to use [Apache Cassandra](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Cassandra-Authentication.html) as an authentication store.

## Custom LDAP Password Policy

There is now support for implementing your own custom LDAP password policy handler based on Ldaptive. Your implementation [needs to be taught to CAS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Properties.html#ldap-authentication) and should take on the following form:

```java
import org.ldaptive.auth.AuthenticationResponseHandler;

public class MyPasswordPolicyAuthenticationResponseHandler implements AuthenticationResponseHandler {
}
```

## FIDO U2F Device Registration

FIDO U2F support for multifactor authentication is now equipped with the ability to store device registration records inside a relational database and more. [See this](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/FIDO-U2F-Authentication.html#registration) for more info.
