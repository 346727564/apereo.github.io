The official CAS `5.2.0` GA was released on [November 27th, 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.2.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.3.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **second** release candidate in the `5.3.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.3.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/12/29/530rc1-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.0-RC2</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of the overlay, adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.3.0-RC2
```

## Minors

1. The embedded Apache Tomcat container is now given the ability to support basic authentication.
2. Caching attributes fetched from external attribute repositories is now corrected to handle caching more efficiently.
3. Thanks to [@leleuj](https://github.com/leleuj), MFA bypass via REST is  corrected to format parameters properly for the REST request.

## Hazelcast Discovery

CAS is now able to leverage Apache jclouds and Microsoft Azure, when it comes to [Hazelcast and auto-discovery](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Hazelcast-Ticket-Registry.html).

## Apache Syncope Authentication

As yet another method of authentication, CAS is now able to [leverage Apache Syncope](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Syncope-Authentication.html) to locate user accounts.

## Registered Services REST API

For some time, CAS has had support for a [REST-like API allowing one to add service definitions](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/REST-Protocol.html) into the registry. This API was quite limited in accepting different properties of a given service definition or different types of services for various protocols. In this release candidate, this API is improved slightly to accept all types of service definitions in the API request body and making it slightly easier to execute such requests with proper authentication and authorization enforcements. 

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. Please revisit the API requests and reformulate them accordingly.
</div>

## SAML2 Service Providers

The following new SAML2 service providers are now supported by CAS out of the box:

- Amazon

## JSON Whitelist Authentication

 A [JSON-based authentication strategy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Whitelist-Authentication.html) is now included that allows one to mimic user account details, mostly useful for development and testing. 

## REST Protocol Credential Extraction

The [CAS REST protocol](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/REST-Protocol.html) in this release candidate is given the ability to extract multiple sets of credentials from the request body and prep them for authentication. In practice this means that various modules, such as [YubiKey](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/YubiKey-Authentication.html) and [Google Authenticator](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/GoogleAuthenticator-Authentication.html), may be allowed to insert a special credential extractor into the REST engine automatically when detected in order to let the REST request achieve MFA. 

## AWS Credential Fetching

For components that tightly integrate with AWS such as [Cloud Directory Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/AWS-CloudDirectory-Authentication.html) or [CloudWatch](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Logging-Cloudwatch.html), etc CAS is now given the ability to fetch credentials from a variety of sources as part of an ordered chain. Sources include system properties, environment variables, EC2 instance metadata, etc. 

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. As part of this change, a number of module names for CloudWatch logging, etc have changed their names to belong to the <code>support</code> category of CAS modules rather than <code>core</code>. Review the documentation and adjust accordingly.
</div>

## Mapped Attribute Value Filters

A [new attribute value filter](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Value-Release-Policies.html#mutant-mapped-regex) is added whose main ability is to filter attribute values by a collection of patterns and then supplant the value dynamically based on the results of the regex match.

## Authenticate Credentials via REST Protocol

[A new REST endpoint](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/REST-Protocol.html#authenticate-credentials) is now exposed that is tasked to only verify the validity of the provided credentials without dealing with the ticket API. 

## REST-based Audits

CAS audit data and logs may now be [POSTed to a REST endpoint](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Audits.html) of your choosing.

## Audit Trail Management

Audit record management in CAS is given the abllity to work with multiple managers, storing audit data in many destinations at the same time. The auditing library is also given the ablity to fetch audit data based on a starting date whose value may be controlled in CAS settings.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>As part of this change, a number of settings that specifically controlled the behavior of audit functionality based on log files and Slf4j have changed location, moving over to a <code>slf4j</code> category. Review the documentation for all settings and adjust accordingly if you have included any of those settings.
</div>
