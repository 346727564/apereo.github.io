The official CAS `5.2.0` GA was released on [November 27th, 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.2.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.3.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **second** release candidate in the `5.3.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.3.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/12/29/530rc1-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.0-RC2</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of the overlay, adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.3.0-RC2
```

## Get Involved

## Das Ende

Big thanks to all who participate in the development of this release to submit patches and contribute improvements. Keep'em coming!
