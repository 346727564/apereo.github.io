The official CAS `6.0.0` GA was released on [December 28th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v6.0.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.1.0`. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **third** release candidate in the `6.1.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2019/03/01/610rc2-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties

### New & Noteworthy

#### OAuth `id_token` Response Type

CAS acting as an [OAuth identity provider](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OAuth-OpenId-Authentication.html) gains support for `id_token` as a new response type.

#### Principal Attribute Repositories 

[Principal attribute repositories](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Release-Caching.html) assigned to a service definition can now narrow down the collection of attribute repositories to fetch attributes at release time. The [attribute resolution engine](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Attribute-Resolution.html) backed by Person Directory is also tweaked to allow for additional filtering mechanisms.

### Other Stuff

- A new actuator endpoint for [Duo Security](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/mfa/DuoSecurity-Authentication.html) to fetch and report back on user account status.
- Allow the OAuth `profile` endpoint to accept and produce claims and attributes with non-primitive complex object types.

### Library Upgrades

- SpotBugs
- Hazelcast AWS
- Couchbase Driver
- Cassandra Driver
- SnakeYAML
- Twilio
- Google Maps
