The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the *second* release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read more about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/06/30/520rc1-release/).

<!-- /TOC -->

## Minors

- Service access strategies based on principal attributes should now correctly be enforced prior to jumping into subsequent factors of authentication.
- Thanks to [@gbatalski](https://github.com/gbatalski), JWT authentication in CAS is now able to support base64-encoded secrets.
- Thanks to [@benht](https://github.com/benht), expired tickets are now properly removed from CAS when using MongoDb ticket registry.
- Thanks to [@klewczuk](https://github.com/klewczuk), refresh tokens are no longer auto-generated when using grant type `refresh_token`.
- Thanks to [@WhiteMarlin](https://github.com/WhiteMarlin), A number of reference to `Jasig` are now removed from CAS language bundles.


## Authentication Plan Configurators

All configuration components in CAS that register authentication handlers into the runtime engine have now become their own `@Bean` marked as `@Conditional` for easier overrides.

## Service Definition File Checking

In the event that a resource-based service registry is employed (i.e. JSON, YAML), additional checks are now built in to ensure that the service files are named appropriately.
 
## Swagger Documentation

CAS is now able to auto-generate [API documentation](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Swagger-Integration.html) for all endpoints, controllers and REST services, via Swagger.

## CAS Demos

A number of URLs for [CAS demos](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/#demos) running on Heroku have changed.

## Multimapped Attributes

CAs gains the ability to map and rename the same attribute definition multiple times to different names.
This can be done either as part of attribute retrieval or at release time.

## Password Management

</div>

[Password management functionality](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Password-Management.html) in CAS is now broken up into distinct modules depending on the backened storage service in use.

## REST Attribute Repository

CAS gains the ability to [contact REST endpoints](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Properties.html#rest) to resolve attributes. 

## Scripted Attribute Repositories

CAS gains the ability to use Java's native scripting functionality for attribute repository sources to support [Groovy, Javascript and Python](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Properties.html#pythonjavascriptgroovy) scripts to resolve and retrieve attributes.

## Surrogate Authn via JDBC

CAS gains the ability to support [surrogate authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Surrogate-Authentication.html) via JDBC resources.

## Library Upgrades

- Apache Tomcat
- Eureka
- Spring Boot admin
