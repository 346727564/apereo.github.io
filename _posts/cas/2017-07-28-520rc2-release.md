The official CAS `5.1.0` GA was released on [May 27th 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.1.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.2.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the *second* release candidate in the `5.2.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.2.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

You can read more about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2017/06/30/520rc1-release/).

<!-- /TOC -->

## 0.1. Minors

- Service access strategies based on principal attributes should now correctly be enforced prior to jumping into subsequent factors of authentication.

## 0.2. Authentication Plan Configurators

All configuration components in CAS that register authentication handlers into the runtime engine have now become their own `@Bean` marked as `@Conditional` for easier overrides.

## 0.3. Service Definition File Checking

In the event that a resource-based service registry is employed (i.e. JSON, YAML), additional checks are now built in to ensure that the service files are named appropriately.
 
## 0.4. Swagger Documentation

CAS is now able to auto-generate [API documentation](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Swagger-Integration.html) for all endpoints, controllers and REST services, via Swagger.

## 0.5. Library Upgrades

- Apache Tomcat

## 0.6. What's Next?

We are all working to make sure the CAS `5.2.0` release is on [schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones).

## 0.7. Get Involved

- Start your CAS deployment today. Try out features and [share feedback](https://apereo.github.io/cas/Mailing-Lists.html).
