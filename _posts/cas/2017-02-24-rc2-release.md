The official CAS `5.0.0` GA was released on [November 7th 2016](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the first release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy 
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

## Authentication Sequence

At runtime, CAS maintains a collection of authentication handlers/strategies that typically execute one after another. Each CAS module that presents a form of authentication strategy will simply insert itself into this collection at bootstrap time. This means the sequence of authentication execution is very much non-deterministic upon server restarts. At the end of the process, the result of all authentication transactions is collected and optionally processed by an authentication policy where success/failure of certain strategies/sources may be taken into account to fully satisfy the authentication requirements.

Starting with this feature release, collection of authentication handlers tries to preserve order in a rather more deterministic way. The idea is that adopters can assign a weight/order value to an authentication handler thereby explicitly positioning it in the collection and controlling its execution sequence. At this time, the LDAP and JDBC authentication handlers are the only ones that have qualified for an `order` setting. 

## Code Cleanup and Optimization

Thanks to community contributions, the CAS codebase is revitalized ever more to make sure
most if not all underlying components adhere to proper coding standards and design practices.
Changes in this area include adjustments to style guidelines, constructor-based dependency injections
and navigating to the native Java 8 lambda APIs. 

## MongoDb Ticket Registry

CAS gains support for MongoDb as a storage machenism for its ticket registry backend.
You can learn more about the registry behavior via [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/MongoDb-Ticket-Registry.html).

## Library Upgrades

- Spring
- Spring Boot


## What's Next?

The development team is working to make sure the CAS `5.1.0` release is 
on [schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). Additional release candidates
and more updates will likely be released prior to the official GA release.
