The official CAS `5.0.0` GA was released on [November 7th 2016](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the first release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy 
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

## Authentication Sequence

At runtime, CAS maintains a collection of authentication handlers/strategies that typically execute one after another. Each CAS module that presents a form of authentication strategy will simply insert itself into this collection at bootstrap time. This means the sequence of authentication execution is very much non-deterministic upon server restarts. At the end of the process, the result of all authentication transactions is collected and optionally processed by an authentication policy where success/failure of certain strategies/sources may be taken into account to fully satisfy the authentication requirements.

Starting with this feature release, the collection of authentication handlers tries to preserve order in a rather more deterministic way. Authentication handlers can be assigned a weight/order value thereby explicitly positioning themselves in the collection and controlling execution sequence. 

At this time, the LDAP and JDBC authentication handlers are the only ones that have qualified for an `order` setting. 

## Code Cleanup and Optimization

Thanks to community contributions, the CAS codebase is revitalized ever more to make sure
most if not all underlying components adhere to proper coding standards and design practices.
Changes in this area include adjustments to style guidelines, constructor-based dependency injections
and navigating to the native Java 8 lambda APIs. 

## MongoDb Ticket Registry

CAS gains support for MongoDb as a storage mechanism for its ticket registry backend.
You can learn more about the registry behavior via [this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/MongoDb-Ticket-Registry.html).

## Custom Password Encoders

The collection of supported authentication password encoders now allows for the specification of a fully qualified `com.example.MyPasswordEncoder` implementation class to handle custom encoding use cases.

## Management Webapp Authorization

Authorized access to the management webapp via LDAP now allows for groups and rols in additional to a single search for the user and attributes.

## Database Audit Default Catalog/Schema

Database audits are now able to take advantage of new settings that control the default catalog and schema.

## CAS Banner & Git Commit Id 

To facilitate testing of `SNAPSHOT` versions, the CAS banner on startup attempts to demonstrate the Git commit id of the release so adopters and developers may exactly determine the version of the source code deployed.

```bash
CAS Version: 5.1.0-RC2-SNAPSHOT
CAS Commit Id: 0b75fabbb0f865c497327695e30ecf08b6f15e63
CAS Build Date/Time: 2017-01-09T21:27:28Z
Spring Boot Version: 1.4.3.RELEASE
Apache Tomcat Version: Apache Tomcat/8.5.9
```

## CAS SAML SP Integrations

CAS adds support for a few additional built-in SAML SP integrations: [Zoom, Asana and Evernote](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-SAML-SP-Integrations.html).

## Minor Bug Fixes

A number of small bug fixes have been incorporated into this feature release:

- Database schema update/generation accounts for more accurate column types and lengths.
- Google Authenticator QR code generation is remapped in the Spring Boot configuration.
- Expiration policy of OAuth refresh tokens is now taking into account the correct time unit of measure.

## Library Upgrades

- Spring
- Spring Boot


## What's Next?

The development team is working to make sure the CAS `5.1.0` release is 
on [schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). Additional release candidates
and more updates will likely be released prior to the official GA release.
