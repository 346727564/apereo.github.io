The official CAS `5.3.0` GA was released on [June 29th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.3.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.0.0`. Note that this is a **major release** of the CAS software which *may* present significant changes in architecture, configuration or behavior. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release.

This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **first** release candidate in the `6.0.0` series.

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>6.0.0-RC1</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-gradle-overlay-template), adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=6.0.0-RC1
```

## Platform Requirements

### Java v11

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. While the change is for the most part invisible to the CAS deployer, it nonetheless presents a significant change in the deployment environment.
</div>

Oracle recently announced that they intend to move Java to a release every six months. Under the new release schedule Oracle proposes strict time-based releases, known as feature releases. These will appear every year in March and September. The new release schedule is intended to begin immediately after the release of Java 9 (which is long-gone at this point), with the next release of Java to come in early 2018.

The release schedule of the CAS software quite happily lends itself to the Java release schedule as well. There has been a feature release once every 6 months or so for the past couple of years and such releases have exclusively been time-based releases with a number of candidates in between them for adopters to experiment. That being said, in order to keep up with the Java release schedule, stay on a supported platform and keep the progress ball moving forward, the minimum required Java version is set to be `11` starting with CAS 6.

This has not been an easy effort; the CAS 6 development has been in progress since February 2018 with early testing of snapshots and release candidates of Java as well as all other software packages and libraries to ensure a successful build and deployment model. For the most part, all functionality continues to remain the same as it was and the change in platform requirements should remain completely invisible to the deployment.

While there are no specific plans as of this writing, there will likely be follow-up feature releases after CAS `6` in form of `6.1`, `6.2`, etc each of which may require and depend on future Java releases such as `12`, `13`, etc.

### Servlet Specification v4

<div class="alert alert-success">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. While the change is for the most part invisible to the CAS deployer, it nonetheless presents a significant change in the deployment environment.
</div>

The [embedded server containers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Servlet-Container.html) provided by CAS (Apache Tomcat, Jetty, etc) have been and will be upgraded to include support for the new specification version. This will most notably include required support for Apache Tomcat 9+.

### Spring v5

Given changes in the platform requirements, the Spring framework that is very heavily used internally by CAS has been updated to its most recent version that is version `5.0.x`. You can ready all about Spring 5 [here](https://springframework.guru/what-is-new-with-spring-framework-5/).

While for the most part the upgrade is rather invisible to the CAS developer and adopter, one area that is negatively impacted by the change is the [SAML2 functionality in CAS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/protocol/SAML-Protocol.html) that uses the Velocity templating engine needed by the [OpenSAML library](https://wiki.shibboleth.net/confluence/display/OS30/Home) to submit SAML responses, etc. Velocity support is [no longer available in Spring 5](https://jira.spring.io/browse/spr-13795) and additional measures are taken in CAS to ensure OpenSAML and friends and continue to do the job without relying on Velocity support assumed to be available with the Spring framework.

### Spring Boot v2

CAS is entirely based on the [Spring Boot framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) at heart, which controls the orchestration and management of CAS settings, configuration modules and many other things. Moving to newer version of the Java platform as well as the Spring framework requires CAS to switch to the latest iteration of the Spring Boot framework, namely version `2.0.x`. You can ready all about Spring Boot 2 [here](https://spring.io/blog/2018/03/01/spring-boot-2-0-goes-ga).

Given the impact and utility of the framework in the CAS codebase, a rather large number of changes have had to be introduced in order to achieve a successful upgrade and keep as much of the functionality as possible. However, a number of areas in CAS are negatively impacted by this upgrade some of which are more visible than others and sometimes for the better. This areas include are but not limited to [CAS metrics](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Metrics.html), [actuator/admin endpoints](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Monitoring-Statistics.html) as well as their security and protection strategy.

## CAS Command-line Shell

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>This is a breaking change, where old CAS functionality is removed and replaced by the new.
</div>

The [CAS command-line shell](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html), as a result of upgrading to the latest Spring Shell version, is impacted such that basic command-line options available in the non-interactive version of the shell are now removed. This means that you may still log into the shell and work with available CAS commands as you did interactively, taking advantage of features such as command history, tab completion, etc.
