The official CAS `5.3.0` GA was released on [June 29th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.3.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.0.0`. Note that this is a **major release** of the CAS software which *may* present significant changes in architecture, configuration or behavior. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release.

This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **third** release candidate in the `6.0.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2018/09/14/600rc2-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties

### New & Noteworthy

#### CouchDb Support

Extensive CouchDb support is now provided by CAS to handle storage concerns when it comes to authentication, audit and throttling, multifactor authentication, and more.
 
#### SAML2 IdP Single Logout

Basic functionality is now included to have CAS submit SAML2 logout requests to service providers, who currently have a registered *session record* with CAS.

#### Delegated AuthN via HiOrg-Server

Delegated authentication is now able to support HiOrg-Server.
 
#### SAML2 Encryptable Attributes

Configuration for SAML2 registered services can now specify attributes that should be optionally included in or excluded from encryption in the final SAML2 response.
  
### Small Stuff

- Delegated authentication is improved to execute the authentication step only once.
- Service access strategy for SAML2 service providers and other service types can now handle the `unauthorizedRedirectUrl` setting.
- Radius authentication now attempts to also submit the client IP address to the radius server.
- Small fixes to the SAML2 callback url pattern construction.
- CAS internal Gradle build should continue to work against IDEA `2018.3 EAP`.
- SAML2 responses can optionally include a `NameID` for `SubjectConfirmation` blocks, on a per-service basis. 
- The background job responsible for cleaning trusted expired MFA records is now scheduled correctly on startup.
- Attribute resolution via external groovy scripts, handled by [PersonDirectory](https://github.com/apereo/person-directory), can now properly recognize the engine name.
- Hazelcast health monitoring imports its reporting of memory statistics.
- Detection of the SAML2 SLO url location in metadata is now changed to locate the `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST` binding.
