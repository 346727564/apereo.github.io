The official CAS `5.0.0` GA was released on [November 7th 2016](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the fourth release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

## SAML2 Service Providers

A few more [SAML2 service providers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-SAML-SP-Integrations.html) are added to this release namely Adobe Cloud, AcademicWorks, Infinite Campus, Slack, Zendesk and more.

## Surrogate Authentiction

The ability to authenticate on behalf of another user, so called [Surrogate Authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Surrogate-Authentication.html), is now included
in this release.

## SAML2 NameID Qualifiers

SAML2 service definitions are now allowed the option to override the name qualifiers for a given subject's name id.

## Scripted Attribute Release

Scripted attribute release policies are now able to accept an inlined groovy script as well.

## Automated Docker Cloud Builds

CAS is now taking advantage of [Docker Cloud's automated builds](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/automated-build/)
to auto-publish CAS images for the `latest` and all other relevant tagged releases. 

## Eureka Service Discovery

Thanks to Spring Cloud, CAS provides integration support for [Eureka Service Discovery](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Service-Discovery-Guide.html). 

## Spring Cloud w/ Apache ZooKeeper

More of a documentation enhancement and thanks to community contributions and expertise, the CAS Spring Cloud configuration server is now able to use [Apache ZooKeeper](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuration-Server-Management.html#apache-zookeeper) as the backend storage service to house CAS settings.

## Logging Enhancements

Another documentation improvement, the [CAS logging guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Logging.html) introduces a few new sections to explain logging layouts. There is also some verbiage that describes how to integrate CAS logs with Papertrail.

## Minor Changes

A number of small bug fixes and improvements have been incorporated into this feature release:

### Community Contributions

- Acceptable Usage Policy is now able to correctly accept and store user decisions.
- Hazelcast ticket registry is now able to property decode and find encrypted tickets.
- Minor updates to CAS messages bundles for non-english languages.
- Support for container-managed JDBC connections is added to this release candidate.

### Others

- MDC logging is now respecting nullable properties of the HTTP request.
- Authy as a multifactor authentication provider gains the ability to specify the country code for the user phone number.
- MFA flows are now able to correctly handle scenarios where authentication produces warnings.
- OAuth2 `password` grant type is now correctly able to issue user profiles.
- Ticket registry cleaner is no longer scheduled as a no-op if it's disabled in the configuration.
- A regression; CAS should resume supporting the duration syntax (i.e `PT20S`) for settings.
- Documentation additions to explain how to generate various signing and ecnryption keys for CAS manually.

## Library Upgrades

- Apache Tomcat
- Spring Cloud
- Hazelcast
- Thymeleaf
- Log4j

## What's Next?

The development team is working to make sure the CAS `5.1.0` release is
on [schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). This is the last release candidate in the `5.1.x` release and the project will gear up to perform a few more rounds of testing and validation before the official GA release is tagged and made available.
