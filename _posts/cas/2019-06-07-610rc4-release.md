The official CAS `6.0.0` GA was released on [December 28th, 2018](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v6.0.0). Since then, the project has been moving forward with the development of the next feature release that is tagged as `6.1.0`. Please review the [release policy](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html) to learn more about the scope of the release. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements and enhancements packed into the **fourth** release candidate in the `6.1.0` series.

You can read about the previous release candidate [here](https://apereo.github.io/2019/04/29/610rc3-release/).

## Shake Well Before Use
{:.no_toc}

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). Note that CAS releases are *strictly* time-based releases; they are not scheduled or based on specific benchmarks, statistics or completion of features. To gain confidence in a particular release, it is strongly recommended that you start early by experimenting with release candidates and/or follow-up snapshots.

In order to start experimenting with release candidates, at any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Overlay

In the `gradle.properties` of [the overlay](https://github.com/apereo/cas-overlay-template), adjust the following setting:

```properties

### New & Noteworthy

#### Required Services for Single SignOn

CAS may be configured to require the user to authenticate from an application before
access can be granted to all other registered services. [See this](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SSO-Session-Cookie.html) for more info.

#### Acceptable Usage Policy Audits

Acceptable Usage Policy choices and results are now passed to the [Audit Log](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Audits.html).

#### Jasypt Configuration Security

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>WATCH OUT!</strong><br/>This is a breaking change. You will need to make sure relevant
  configuration values are updated to remain functional.
</div>

Configuration properties secured and encrypted via Jasypt are required to be prefixed with
`{cas-cipher}` instead of `{cipher}` so as to avoid conflicts with Spring Cloud way of encrypting
and decrypting values.

#### Jasypt Encryption with CAS Shell

A new `decrypt-value` command is added to [CAS Commandline Shell](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html) to verify encrypted values.

#### Registered Services Actuator Endpoint

The `registeredServices` actuator endpoint gains a `DELETE` operation to remove registered services from CAS.

#### OpenID Connect Dynamic Registration

Many incremental improvements to support OpenID Connect dynamic registration of RPs with richer metadata
in the registration request, such as handling of `policy_uri`, `tos_uri`, `logo_uri`, etc.

### Other Stuff

- Assigning identifiers to registered services is modified to not produce negative numeric ids.
- Password policy warning messages should now be recognized by Memcached and the Kryo serialization engine.
- Trivial fix to CAS commandline shell ensure the runtime can recognize CAS configuration settings internally. 

### Library Upgrades
