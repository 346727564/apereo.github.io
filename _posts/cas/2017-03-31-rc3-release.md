The official CAS `5.0.0` GA was released on [November 7th 2016](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the third release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

If you are looking for additional info on the previous release candidate, [please see this post](https://apereo.github.io/2017/02/24/rc2-release/).

## Embedded Container Modules

In previous feature releases, the CAS server web application module shipped automatically with an embedded Tomcat container.
This presented a few difficulties to folks who wanted to step outside the box and get the CAS web application deployed in alternative
containers such as WebSphere, JBoss, etc.

Starting with this release candidate, the CAS server web application switches back to its original vanialla state where nothing is embedded by default. This should allow you to deploy CAS to any container that is servlet-spec compliant by CAS requirements. However, [additional modules are provided for embedded containers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Servlet-Container.html) that are Apache Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow. If you had been previously working with the embedded container and running Apache Tomcat natively, you do need to switch the webapp module to one that contains an embedded container of your choice.

Note that embedded-container modules may be deployed to externally-configured containers too. CAS should detect the external instance and auto-disable the embedded container from bootstrapping itself, regardless of container type.

## Hazelcast Ticket Registry

Thanks to community contributions, the Hazelcast Ticket Registry is [reorganized](https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/2361) to improve its performance, by splitting the underlying cache in half. Work is also done to ensure the registry is prepped to handle additional ticket types dynamically.

## SPNEGO Webflow Authentication

The [SPNEGO functionality](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/SPNEGO-Authentication.html) still had a few references and instructions on how changes that needed to be manually applied to the webflow. Those are now removed and automated internally to match the manual steps.

## JPA Ticket Registry

The [JPA ticket registry](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/JPA-Ticket-Registry.html) no longer requests a hardcoded dependency link to the OAuth module. In the past, the registry simply auto-created OAuth tables and entities given the components were found and scanned automatically as a result of that dependency link. Today, that chain is removed and the registry shall only recognize and act upon OAuth functionality, if the functionality is explicitly turned on.

## Ticket Metadata and Catalog



## What's Next?

The development team is working to make sure the CAS `5.1.0` release is
on [schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). Additional release candidates
and more updates will likely be released prior to the official GA release.
