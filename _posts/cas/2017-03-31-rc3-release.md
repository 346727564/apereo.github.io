The official CAS `5.0.0` GA was released on [November 7th 2016](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the third release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

If you are looking for additional info on the previous release candidate, [please see this post](https://apereo.github.io/2017/02/24/rc2-release/).

## Embedded Container Modules

In previous feature releases, the CAS server web application module shipped automatically with an embedded Tomcat container.
This presented a few difficulties to folks who wanted to step outside the box and get the CAS web application deployed in alternative
containers such as WebSphere, JBoss, etc.

Starting with this release candidate, the CAS server web application switches back to its original vanialla state where nothing is embedded by default. This should allow you to deploy CAS to any container that is servlet-spec compliant by CAS requirements. However, [additional modules are provided for embedded containers](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Servlet-Container.html) that are Apache Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow. If you had been previously working with the embedded container and running Apache Tomcat natively, you do need to switch the webapp module to one that contains an embedded container of your choice.

Note that embedded-container modules may be deployed to externally-configured containers too. CAS should detect the external instance and auto-disable the embedded container from bootstrapping itself, regardless of container type.

## Hazelcast Ticket Registry

Thanks to community contributions, the Hazelcast Ticket Registry is [reorganized](https://github.com/apereo/cas/pull/2361) to improve its performance, by splitting the underlying cache in half. Work is also done to ensure the registry is prepped to handle additional ticket types dynamically.

## Administrative Endpoint Security

Individual endpoints that are exposed by the CAS admin panels each have their own security settings. To make the configuration easier, there now exists a single block that may control the security of all settings globally, while still allowing individual overrides to take over.

As an additional option, endpoints that are secured with Spring Security now can take advantage of JAAS authentication.

## SPNEGO Webflow Authentication

The [SPNEGO functionality](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/SPNEGO-Authentication.html) still had a few references and instructions on how changes that needed to be manually applied to the webflow. Those are now removed and automated internally to match the manual steps.

## JPA Ticket Registry

The [JPA ticket registry](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/JPA-Ticket-Registry.html) no longer requests a hardcoded dependency link to the OAuth module. In the past, the registry simply auto-created OAuth tables and entities given the components were found and scanned automatically as a result of that dependency link. Today, that chain is removed and the registry shall only recognize and act upon OAuth functionality, if the functionality is explicitly turned on.

## Ticket Metadata and Catalog

Traditionally, ticket types in CAS are mostly concerned with ticket-granting tickets, service tickets, proxy tickets, etc. These are distinct types that are defined as first-class citizens of the CAS public API. Over time, there have emerged additional tickets types that represent various other forms of *tokens* to CAS, such as OAuth codes, access tokens, refresh tokens, etc. Each ticket type has its own lifespan and other settings too. How do ticket registries deal with additional types, given their presence and functionality can only be discovered at runtime dynamically?

Some took shortcuts. For instance, the JPA ticket registry created a hard-link to the OAuth module (described above) so it could ensure OAuth tickets were stored in separate tables as distinct entities, etc. It asked for pre-authorized knowledge of the CAS API, even though the functionality controlled by that API may not even be in use at all. Is there a reason the registry should handle OAuth-related functionality *even when* OAuth is not even enabled or required by the deployment?

Not a trick question.

So the target goal is that each registry implementation (and all of CAS really) should be able to dynamically realize what ticket types are used by the CAS runtime and what ticketing-related functionality is actually enabled by the deployer. The discovery mechanism should provide enough information, as a catalog, to the relevant modules about known types, their metadata and various other required properties so each registry can dynamically and generically look up that metadata and regroup itself to handle each unique type. Advantages of this approach are:

1. No need to establish static linkage between CAS modules to teach each about various ticket types exposed in the module API. As you can imagine, over time given new tickets types that have emerged and the list of registries supported by CAS, static linking is simply non-maintainable and core logic in each registry can get very messy if it were to deal with 8+ different ticket types, caches, storage requirements, etc.
2. Given no static linking, LOC will be reduced down to the bare minimum and what may be auto-discovered at runtime.
3. Given no static linking, maintenance and extensions to the CAS API can be done much more comfortably.
4. Given no static linking, the amount of extra [yet needless] work that would be carried out by each registry is only activated *IIF* the feature is actually utilized by the deployment.

So starting with this release candidate, modules that intend to provide their own special flavors of tickets when necessary register the relevant types into the "global ticket catalog" as it were. Registries are then freed up look into the catalog and reorganize themselves as needed to handle all ticket types.

## Configuration Panel

A number of enhancements are applied to the CAS configuration panel to ensure it can detect properties that are changed manually
in configuration sources (i.e `cas.properties`). The panel is also able to now immediately apply configuration changes at runtime in memory as adhoc overrides, though support will be added later for such changes to actually be written back to the configuration source.

## CAS Heroku Demos

Demo instances of both the CAS server and CAS Management server web applications have been updated to run the latest versions of CAS 5.

## Minor Bug Fixes

A number of small bug fixes have been incorporated into this feature release:

- OAuth services are now properly recognized during the logout process.

## Library Upgrades

- Spring
- Hazelcast
- ...

## What's Next?

The development team is working to make sure the CAS `5.1.0` release is
on [schedule](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). Additional release candidates
and more updates will likely be released prior to the official GA release.
