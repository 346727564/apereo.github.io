The official CAS `5.0.0` GA was released on [November 7th 2016](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.0.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.1.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the third release candidate in the `5.1.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.1.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

If you are looking for additional info on the previous release candidate, [please see this post](https://apereo.github.io/2017/02/24/rc2-release/).

## Embedded Container Modules

In previous feature releases, the CAS server web application module shipped automatically with an embedded Tomcat container.
This presented a few difficulties to folks who wanted to step outside the box and get the CAS web application deployed in alternative
containers such as WebSphere, JBoss, etc.

Starting with this release candidate, the CAS server web application switches back to its original vanialla state where nothing is embedded by default. This should allow you to deploy CAS to any container that is servlet-spec compliant. However, additional modules are provided for embedded containers that are Apache Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow. If you had been previously working with the embedded container and running Tomcat natively, you do need to switch the webapp module to one that contains an embedded container.

Note that embedded-container modules may be deployed to externally-configured containers too. CAS should detect the external instance auto-disable the embedded container from bootstrapping itself, regardless of container type.
