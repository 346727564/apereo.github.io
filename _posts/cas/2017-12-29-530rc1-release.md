The official CAS `5.2.0` GA was released on [November 27th, 2017](https://github.com/apereo/cas/releases/tag/v5.2.0). Since then,
the project has been moving forward with development of the next feature release
that is tagged as `5.3.0`. This post intends to highlight some of the improvements
and enhancements packed into the **first** release candidate in the `5.3.0` series.

The in-development documentation of CAS `5.3.0` is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/).
The release schedule is also [available here](https://github.com/apereo/cas/milestones). The release policy
is [available here](https://apereo.github.io/cas/developer/Release-Policy.html).

## Shake Well Before Use

We strongly recommend that you take advantage of the release candidates as they come out. Waiting for a `GA` release is only going to set you up for unpleasant surprises. A `GA` is simply [a tag and nothing more](https://apereo.github.io/2017/03/08/the-myth-of-ga-rel/). In order to start experimenting with release candidates, use the following strategies.

At any given time, you should be able to append `-SNAPSHOT` to the CAS version specified in order to take advantage of snapshot builds as changes are made and published.

### Apache Maven

In the `pom.xml` of the overlay, adjust the following tag to match below:

```xml
<cas.version>5.3.0-RC1</cas.version>
```

### Gradle

In the `gradle.properties` of the overlay, adjust the following setting to match below:

```properties
cas.version=5.3.0-RC1
```

## Minors

1. A boolean flag is now exposed in CAS settings to toggle [Google reCAPTCHA](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Configuring-Google-reCAPTCHA.html) behavior.
2. Scratch codes for [Google Authenticator multifactor authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/GoogleAuthenticator-Authentication.html) are now properly recognized as valid tokens.
3. A series of small bug fixes to ensure claims and scopes are properly recognized and released via the [OpenID Connect protocol](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/OIDC-Authentication.html).
 4. Thanks to [@Thaslin](https://github.com/Thaslin),[delegating authentication to ADFS](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/ADFS-Integration.html) gains support for WCTX while handling concurrent requests. This problem manifests itself when multiple iframes redirect to CAS at nearly the same time. Since only one static session key was used for the CAS service, all requests were redirected to the same service URL after authentication success. Using the WCTX parameter as part of the session key solves this problem.
 5. Thanks to [@pdrados](https://github.com/pdrados), [risk-based authentication](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-RiskBased-Authentication.html) gains a few new fixes  when CAS begins to calculate the authentication risk factor based on date/time.
 6. Thanks to [@robertoschwald](https://github.com/robertoschwald), the CAS protocol specification is slightly revved to provide a few fixes to the XSD schema and to remove the `memberOf` attribute.
 7. A number of improvements to URL validators by [@swoeste](https://github.com/swoeste) to support *unknown* yet valid TLDs. Regex support is now added to CAS http configuration to ensure url authorities can be correctly verified based on that pattern.
8. Thanks to [@hdeadman](https://github.com/hdeadman), the [command-line shell](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Commandline-Shell.html) is slightly improved when it's asked to add properties for a configuration group that is not strictly controlled by CAS itself. (i.e. `add-property -group tomcat`).
  
## CosmosDb Service Registry

CAS service definitions can now be managed and controlled via Microsoft Azure's [CosmosDb](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/CosmosDb-Service-Management.html).

## Service Replication via Hazelcast

In the event that CAS service definitions are not managed globally via a centralized store, service definition files managed as JSON or YAML files can be replicated across the CAS cluster [via Hazelcast](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-Service-Replication.html) in addition to the native tooling options of the CAS platform.

## Documentation CleanUp

 A large number of CAS settings that are shared and common across modules are cleaned up to only be referenced once in a common area, pointing to a specific configuration key. This is a gradual effort and will take some time to complete.

 For instance, when it comes to MongoDb support there are a large number of CAS modules and components that support and integrate with it whose settings, structurally, are very much shared. Consider the dupplicated settings below for features `feature1` and `feature2`:
 
 ```properties
cas.feature1.mongo.host=localhost1
cas.feature1.mongo.timeout=2000

cas.feature2.mongo.host=localhost2
cas.feature2.mongo.timeout=4000
 ```
 
 Instead, the common settings such as `host`, `timeout`, etc are moved to a common block and take the form of:
 
  ```properties
${configurationKey}.mongo.host=localhost1
${configurationKey}.mongo.timeout=2000
  ```
  
  ...where the `configurationKey` can either be `cas.feature1` or `cas.feature2`, etc.

  <div class="alert alert-warning">
  <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
  <strong>Beware</strong><br/>As part of the cleanup, the property <code>userFilter</code> that dealt with LDAP authentication filters and queries is now deprecated and replaced with <code>seachFilter</code> to be consistent with all other LDAP integration modules and features.
</div>
 
## Dynamic Metadata Management

Managing service provider metadata documents, especially for bilateral integrations can now be done with the likes of MongoDB, SQL databases or Groovy, etc. [See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/installation/Configuring-SAML2-Authentication.html#dynamic-metadata) for more info.

## Delegated Authentication Access Policy

In the event that CAS is allowed and configured to delegate the authentication request to an external provider such as a SAML2 IdP, you may now assign policies to registered service definitions in the CAS service registry to let each service control the set of authorized external identity providers. This behavior is enforced in the UI and while tickets are generated or validated.

[See this guide](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development/integration/Delegate-Authentication.html) for more info.
