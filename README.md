# Apereo Foundation Blog

## Building and running locally

This blog is built and hosted in GitHub Pages, which is a SaaS implementation of Jekyll.

You can locally run Jekyll to build the site from source and even serve it up, e.g. to preview your in-development changes.

TODO: Document how to do this. Naive `bundle exec jekyll serve` [apparently](https://cl.ly/3L17410l1V2k) isn't enough.
